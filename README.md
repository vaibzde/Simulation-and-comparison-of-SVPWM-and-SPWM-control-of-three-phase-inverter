# Simulation-and-comparison-of-SVPWM-and-SPWM-control-of-three-phase-inverter
We have made our B.Tech Final Year Project on "Simulation and comparison of SVPWM and SPWM control of three phase inverter"
In our Project, we have done simulations in Matlab for the Sinusoidal Pulse Width Modulation and Space Vector Pulse Width Modulation control. And did the harmonic comparison between SPWM and SVPWM.
To control two-level inverters, various pulse width modulation (PWM) techniques are used; 
SPWM and SVPWM techniques are widely used
We are doing this project under the supervision of Prof. Sanjaya Kumar Sahu Sir (BIT Durg).
